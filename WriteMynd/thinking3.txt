The process of taking time out to focus on yourself can remove mental blocks and allow you to use all your brainpower to better understand yourself, others and the world around you. We shouldn’t be afraid of strong feelings. They tell us what’s going on and help us react. Write Mynd plays your own information back to you in different ways. It makes it easy to spot patterns in your feelings and behaviour and better understand them as a result. Listening to our feelings and understanding them helps us build better relationships, communicate better and resolve conflict more easily.


Looking back on your emotions over time increases self-awareness. By re-living positive experiences as well as negative ones, you are reminded of your strengths and capabilities when self-doubt appears. The release of endorphins and dopamine when you reflect back on emotions can boost your self-esteem and mood.
