Everyone needs a space where they can be totally honest, even if it’s just with themselves. Acknowledging your thoughts honestly has a positive impact on mental wellbeing. Just thinking about how you really feel, away from the distractions of modern life, can help you clarify your thoughts and emotions. Being honest about anger, sadness and pain can help release the intensity of these feelings and focus you in the present. Journaling brings you into that state of mindfulness; past and future frustrations lose their edge in the present moment.  It calls a wandering mind to attention, encouraging you to actively engaging with your thoughts.


When we actively record an emotion, it makes the feeling graspable. In doing this, you can free yourself from overthinking about hypotheticals and becoming emotionally tangled.
