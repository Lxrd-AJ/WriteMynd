As humans, we love to share. We get a nice dose of dopamine each time we do it. There's a cathartic effect of off-loading problems and getting things 'off your chest'. It's anonymous so you can feel confident in being completely honest about how you feel without fear of judgement.
Write Mynd also provides a space for empathising with others and realising that you're not alone. This allows for deeper connections with others.
